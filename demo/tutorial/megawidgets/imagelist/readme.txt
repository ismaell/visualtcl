This sample contains the following files:

imagelist.tcl
    a reusable widget that can be imported into any vTcl project

imagelist_project.tcl
    the project that is used to edit the megawidget, its children,
    and the code for the megawidget

imagelist_test.tcl
    a test project that demonstrates the use of an image list

==============================================================

Here is how the "imagelist.tcl" file was created:

- open the imagelist_project.tcl file in Visual Tcl

- to create the megawidget, select the "MegaWidget" in the widget
  tree, create a compound, name it "Image List" and select all
  the procedures in the ::imagelist namespace

- to save the megawidget, save the compound as "imagelist.tcl"
