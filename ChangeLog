ChangeLog for Visual Tcl:

1.51b4 -> 1.51rc0
    o Added code to select pages in tabnotebook and notebook widgets
      when selecting a frame in the widget tree
    o Made sure Visual Tcl doesn't change the manager for childsites!
      This was the "manager switches from pack to place" mysterious bug,
      which is actually not a Tk bug at all. What happened is when
      a widget is selected, if it is hidden, Visual Tcl tried to re-
      manage it using the default manager.
    o Unregister widgets (delete their namespace) when destroyed
    o Cleaned up the keyboard scrolling in the property manager.
    o Fixed a bug where options would get changed while scrolling in the
      property manager.
    o Fixed delete toplevel bug
    o Added support for deleting childsites in notebook/panedwindow (Tix)
    o Added support for deleting childsites in tabnotebook/notebook [Iwidgets]
    o Added notebook widget for Itcl. Supports copy/paste.
    o Common options like -background take their default values on project
      load unless, of course, the option is saved in the project
    o Support copy/paste for megawidgets tixPanedWindow and tixNoteBook
    o Megawidgets don't save their internal grid geometry
    o Added necessary compound code to allow copy/paste of megawidgets with
      childsites. Enabled tabnotebook and panedwindow [Iwidgets] with this
      functionality.
    o Fixed copy/paste bug where megawidgets would lose their options after
      saving.
    o Added code to prevent special IWidgets binding tags from beeing saved
      in the project.

1.51b3 -> 1.51b4
    o Now prevents the user from trying to assign the same alias to 2 or more
      widgets inside the same toplevel.
    o Added <Shift-ButtonRelease-1> command in the toolbar to auto-place widgets
    o Added column and row stretch options to tkTable library
    o When a toplevel compound is inserted, do not require the user to click
      anywhere, because this does not make sense. Instead, insert the compound
      directly.
    o Fixed copy/paste problem for toplevels.
    o Fixed "ask for widget name on insert" problem for toplevels.
    o When inserting a compound, widgets are registered one at a time as
      the compound is created, instead of after the compound creation. This
      allows default values for the widget to be known and applied when
      possible (see below).
    o When inserting a compound, widgets for which options aren't specified
      take their default values for the most common options like -background,
      -highlightbackground, etc. This reduces the size of saved projects.
    o Made the "-width" option for scrollbar widgets not saved by default (the
      user can still override the option by clicking on the checkbox next to the
      "-width" option)
    o Have the most common options like -background, -activebackground etc.
      take their default value when a widget is created, instead of using the
      value from the options database. This saves space when saving projects, and
      makes it easier to port them to other platforms.
    o Fixed "Set command" bug where it would prevent from saving the project
    o Made sure -label, -anchor and other options are saved
    o Fixed error when inserting compound for the first time after starting vTcl
    o The behavior for aliases in compounds is modified as such:
      - if there are aliases in the compound, define them when compound is inserted
        (so the alias will point to the pasted widget, not the original one, but
         because vTcl allows same aliases to exist in several toplevels, this is
         not a problem)
      - if there are no aliases for subwidgets in the compound, and the
        "Auto Aliasing for New Widgets" option is turned on, then new automatic
        aliases are created
      - if a compound is pasted into a toplevel with an alias that already exists
        in the same toplevel, then a new automatic alias is created
    o Added right-click menu in attributes editor to allow setting an option for
      a range of widgets at once, as well as to save/not save options and restore
      the default value for an option

1.51b2 -> 1.51b3
    o Usability improvements:
      - added "Set Variable" for checkbutton and radiobutton
      - added "Set Value" for radiobutton
      - added "Edit Menu" for toplevel
    o Cosmectic improvements:
      - regrouped toolbar buttons and close button in the same line in both
        the menu and the bindings editor
    o Tried to fix the not-totally-fixed cursor bug. Seems the
      ButtonRelease-1 gets processed before ButtonPress-1 returns,
      so if ButtonRelease-1 comes too soon, it is posted as an
      "after" job. This prevents the cursor from changing to "fleur"
      in some situations.
    o Widget tree keeps highlighting the selection after refresh
    o TkCon restores position on vTcl startup
    o Set string input dialog entry field to white background and
      changed OK / Cancel buttons to icons (checkmark and red cross)
    o Activating a widget now automatically scrolls widget tree into view
    o Fixed message text input dialog Escape bug
    o Added "Set Text Variable" context menu item to entry widget
    o Fixed problem where vTcl was saving duplicate fonts.
    o Fixed some bug where problems could occur from defining namespaces
      with a space in the name.
    o Deleting a menu in the widget tree refreshes an open menu editor
    o Deleting a toplevel menu closes a possibly open menu editor
    o Editing a submenu brings menu editor for root menu and selects
      submenu
    o Raised the labels on the property manager.  As each individual option
      is selected, the label becomes sunken.  This is a cosmetic change
      that is in place for a future enhancement.
    o Added scrolling through the property manager using direction keys.
    o Added Jeffrey Hobbs' TkCon as the default console on all platforms.
    o If you quit, it no longer asks you twice if you want to quit.
    o Cleaned up the import header code.
    o Cleaned up all the library import headers.
    o Tclets now save images as inline as well as font definitions
    o Added menu keyboard shortcuts in main window
    o Added keyboard accelerators where missing, eg. in bindings
      editor, menu editor, system inspector, image manager, font
      manager, you can use any of the standard Accelerators like
      Ctrl + Q, Ctrl + N, etc
    o Added code so that Ctrl + C, Ctrl + V, Ctrl + X, Delete do
      act differently if invoked from entry or text widget in
      a visual tcl window (eg. if you press Delete in an entry
      field inside the menu editor, it shouldn't delete the
      currently selected widget)
    o A few fixes to import vTcl 1.20-1.22 projects:
      - hidden toplevels are shown/hidden when importing a project,
        then they show up in the widget tree and get saved properly,
        including their aliases
      - when saving ignore aliases to non-existing widgets
      - when a hidden toplevel is shown for the first time, it gets
        registered
    o Fixed font saving bug not totally fixed in 1.51b2; adding
      and deleting fonts now works properly
    o Images are now saved with platform independent filenames
    o A few fixes for Macintosh compatibility:
      - made sure [file join] is used when loading widgets
      - made sure titlebars appear properly
      - changed button with pulldown menu to label in menu editor
      - "Save As..." dialog box doesn't use -filetypes on Mac
      - main window now resizes automatically, positions itself
        just below the Macintosh menu bar
    o Fixed menu dump bug (manager switches to place and
      project cannot be reloaded)
    o Added menus to bindings editor
    o Added menus to menu editor (sic)
    o Fixed "Delete" bug in menu editor
    o Adding a cascade in menu editor refreshes widget tree
      and activates widget
    o Fixed cursor bug (when user selected a widget with a different
      cursor then selected a toplevel, the toplevel was getting the
      cursor from the widget)
    o Added more credits in About box for combobox, multicolumn listbox
      and progress bar
    o Added support for labeledframe in Iwidgets

1.51b1 -> 1.51b2
    o Defined a Tktable widget.
    o Support for childsites in the following Iwidgets:
      tabnotebook, panedwinodw
    o Support for childsites in the following tix widgets:
      tixNotebook, tixPanedWindow
    o Eliminates aliases to non-existing widgets on saving
    o Widget tree displays widgets in childsites
    o Widget tree right-click menu
    o Fixed font saving bug introduced in 1.51b1
    o Added "Cancel" button for image/font selection pull-down menu

1.22   -> 1.51b1
    o Added a configure script to locate the best WISH shell.
    o Changed the way libs are loaded
    o Support for mclistbox and combobox from Bryan Oakley. This time,
      no additional packages are needed, and when projects are saved, the
      necessary mclistbox or combobox code is included
    o Support for Iwidgets and BLT with new widget description mechanism
    o Megawidgets such as Iwidgets can now be selected/dragged as a whole
    o Added checkboxes to save only the options the user wants to.
    o Redone menu editor.
    o Added MRU to command console. Up/down arrows navigate through
      previously issued commands.
    o Added system inspector to view variables, procedures, windows,
      bindings, namespaces, packages
    o Completely redone the binding editor. Should be easier to use and
      less error prone (forgot to click on "update" ?)
	o Removed "type" as a means of identifying widgets.  Widgets are all
	  identified by class.
	o If you iconify/deiconify vTcl, it takes the toplevels with it.
	o Changed the default color for all vTcl windows to #d9d9d9.
	o Completely re-wrote the way widgets are defined.
	o Added widget command aliasing.
	o Added widget auto-aliasing
	o Added a pointer icon to the toolbar and continuous widget placement.
	o Added more options to the right-click menu.
	o Fixed a bug where clicking a Toplevel window in the widget tree
	  would cause its manager to change, thereby breaking the project
	  the next time it was sourced.
	o When a project is saved, we save the hidden toplevel windows too,
	  we just don't show them again.  But, the next time we load the
	  project, they're properly included in the project and on the widget
	  tree.
	o Cleaned up the order in which widget selection occurs when a widget
	  is deleted or cut.
	o Added a menu option to Restore a project from backup.
	o revamped Preferences... dialog (cool no?)
    o added an option in the Preferences... dialog to save all images as
      inline using Base64. Allows for self contained projects without any
      dependencies on external images. However, while editing the project,
      external files are used as usual. When saving the project, external
      image files are then converted to Base64 and included inside the main
      file.
	o if a widget is of an unknown class, just ignore it, instead
	  of generating an exception
	o changed the way widget placement is handled.  It is now more like a
	  traditional GUI builder.  This can be turned off in the preferences
	  menu.
	o added support for recent projects in the File menu.
	o fixed a bug concerning the placement of toplevel windows.
	o fixed a bug that caused a problem if the console window was killed
	  through the OS window manager.
	o added a lot more functions to the right-click menu.
    o added tutorial.html to doc folder (html version of the tutorial.txt file)
    o added multiple file support
    o added option in Preferences dialog for "Single file project" or
      "Multiple files project"
    o replaced header path to wish from "wish8.0" to "wish" to accomodate
      any possible version of Tk (in the ideal world, it should do some
      version checking, because vTcl is not compatible with versions prior
      to 8.0)
    o syntax coloring is done when user moves the cursor inside the
      current line or types a few typical keys (eg. [] {}, etc.)
    o fixed "Save Compound..." bug
	o dump widget aliases inside window procedure in preparation for
      multiple file support

        o Fixed root window placer bug
        o Added "Clear" pulldown menu in command console under Linux
        o Added modifier pulldown menu in bindings editor
        o Added right-click popup menu in bindings editor to insert a
          percent substitution
        o Scrollbar borderwidth uses default option value
          (makes the app more consistent looking)
        o Menus are now dumped relative to their top-level window
        o Don't display in widget tree temporary menu windows with "#" in
          their name
        o Added new menu in attributes bar to edit a submenu
        o Display menu item titles in widget tree window
        o Widget tree remembers scrolling position when new widget added or
          existing widget deleted
        o If an image is not found while loading a project, then the image is
          searched for in the project directory
        o Fixed problem when loading a 1.21 project in 1.22b1 and stock images
          were not found

1.21 -> 1.22b1 (released August 5, 2000)
        o When saving -xscrollcommand, -yscrollcommand, and -command options,
          if options are about scrolling then window path is replaced by
          $base... id. the path is now relative to the parent window instead of
          beeing absolute
        o Centered preferences dialog
        o Support for combobox package (combobox by Bryan Oakley)
        o Font manager/Image manager now use default background/foreground
          colors

	o Added button in toolbar to show/hide the command console
        o Fixed bug when loading 1.2 project, saving it and reloading it
          generates error for -font option
        o Added safeguard in "Preferences" dialog to prevent the user from
          activating the "Autoload compounds" option without having specified
          a filename
        o Added initial syntax coloring for binding editor (thanks Nelson)
        o Added more descriptive labels in the widget tree window (thanks
          Eric Taylor)
	o Added Iwidgets tabnotebook and panedwindow
	o Added parameters to generated window procedures so that if the
	  'container' argument is set to 1, the toplevel window is not created;
	  this allows to fill in childsites for Iwidgets such as tabnotebook or
	  panedwindow
	o Fixed bug when adding new procedure with empty name

1.20 -> 1.21 (May 2000)
