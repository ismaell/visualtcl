 I. INTRODUCTION

   Visual Tcl is a freely-available, cross-platform application development
   for the Tcl/Tk language.

   Visual Tcl is covered by the GNU General Public License.
   Please read the LICENSE file for more information.


 II. INSTALLATION

    o  Unzip or untar Visual Tcl into a permanent location. On Unix, I
       recommend /usr/local/vtcl or /usr/vtcl. On Windows, a good default
       is "C:\vtcl". On Macintosh, I recommend you do this inside of the
       folder in which Tcl/Tk was installed. It is important to note that
	   on Windows, you must use WinZip (www.winzip.com) or another zip
	   which supports long file names and nested directories. This is the
	   most common difficulty Windows users encounter.


                                    UNIX

    o  edit "vtcl" shell script
       Change PATH_TO_WISH to the location of the wish binary
       Change VTCL_HOME to the directory from step 1.

    o  Put vtcl in your path (/usr/local/bin or /usr/bin) or change your
       path to include ${VTCL_HOME)

    o  Make sure your DISPLAY environment variable is set and type "vtcl".


                              WINDOWS 95 and NT

	o  Make SURE you use Winzip from http://www.winzip.com
       Other zip programs fail to preserve long file names and nested
	   directory structures.

    o  If you wish to create "shortcuts" to the vt.tcl icon, make sure
       you edit the "startup directory" to the base installation directory
       for Visual Tcl.

    o  You will need to associate all ".tcl" files with the Wish appplication.

    o  Double-click on "vt.tcl" icon.


                                  MACINTOSH

    o  Start the Wish shell interpreter.

    o  "cd" to the Folder in which Visual Tcl was installed.

    o  type "source vtclmac".


 III. REQUIREMENTS

    Tcl7.6 and Tk4.2 or newer. You can obtain a binary for most platforms
    from http://www.scriptics.com/. If not, source code is also available.
